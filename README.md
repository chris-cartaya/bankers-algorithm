# Banker's Algorithm

C++ implementation of the Banker's Algorithm to determine whether a system state is safe or unsafe.

### Features (v1.0)

- Fixed-size matrices for allocation and max
- Computation of the need matrix
- Safety check for multiple given Available vectors
- Outputs safe sequence when state is safe

### Planned Features

- Step-by-step simulation output
- User input mode
- Struct/class version (OOP refactor)
- Makefile
